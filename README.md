# :warning: NOTE:

The following isn't some silly blah blah or anything. It's a serious warning.
Always remember that port scanning etc. can be illegal if you don't have any
permissions to do that. You can end up in jail for being a blackhat.

- This tool is only for ethical purposes. 
- I'm not responsible for your actions. 
- Don't hack anyone without permissions.
- With great force follows great responsibility.
